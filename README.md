 In Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2000), a two step kernel based estimator was derived to estimate the latent density of private values using observed bids in first price sealed-bid auctions. They showed that this estimator achieves the best rate for uniform convergence. 

In Ma, Marmer and Shneyerov (2019), the asymptotic normality is established using results from empirical processes and V-statistics. They also proposed a consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance as well as showed the validity of bootstrap. One of the key assumptions is that the same bandwidth is used in the first stage, where the density of bids is estimated, and in the second stage where the density of private values is estimated using the inferred pseudo-values from first stage. 

In this project, I plan to replicate the Monte-Carlo results in GPV, some results from Ma, Marmer and Shneyreov (2019).
